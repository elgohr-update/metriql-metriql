Metriql is an open-source metrics store which allows companies to define their metrics as code and share them across their BI and data tools easily.
It uses [dbt](https://getdbt.com) for the transformation layer and integrate with dbt via its [manifest.json artifact](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json). 
You can learn more about metriql from [here](https://metriql.com/introduction/intro).

This is the core repository of the [metriql](http://metriql.com) project. It includes the JDBC driver, REST API, and the CLI.

## Running Metriql in your IDE

Run the following commands to pull Metriql and build it locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/metriql/metriql.git
cd metriql
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
cd ./frontend && npm run build
```

We suggest using Intellij, here are the configuration that you need to run Metriql locally. Here is the required configuration:

```
Main class: com.metriql.ServiceStarterKt
Program arguments: serve --jdbc --manifest-json "https://metriql.github.io/metriql-public-demo/manifest.json"
```

Once you're with the setup, please make sure that:

* [dbt profile setup](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile) is done for Metriql to connect your database.
* [Additional dependencies](https://github.com/metriql/metriql/blob/master/Dockerfile#L27) are installed locally for Metriql to integrate with downstream tools.
